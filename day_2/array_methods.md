.sort - Sorts the contents of an array sequentially or in alphabetical order.
Sort can be reversed with the proper operator, or made permanent (destructive) with .sort!

.each - Calls every element of an array and applies any operations or methods to each element

.collect - Similar to each in that it calls every element and performs an operation on it, but it also creates a new array with the results.

.first - returns the first element or first (n) number of elements in an array.

.last - same as above, but works from the end of the array to the front.

.shuffle - returns a new array with elements shuffled.
